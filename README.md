##### Comment
  * This has been my first multi-user game development, and honestly this opportunity made me think in different views in order to handle the interface for multiple users. It was hard but I enjoyed. I still know weak points of this app as I can think of a couple of ways I break this app. So, if you see some embarrassing behavior, please try reloading or let me know.
